#The format of this file is pretty nasty, and it takes a lot of toying
#around to get it functional, but whenever you save it, it's automatically
#reloaded, so that should make things easier.
#
#The format of the file is as follows (according to column)
#
#[Name of block] NO SPACES ALLOWED!
#[ID of Block]   Refer to: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Data_values
#[Meta of Block] ??? It's some sort of other value attached to something,
#                just put -1 in for now, which means it applies to all metas
#[Block Density] The "density" of the block (how fat it should appear) valid
#                values are from .01 ... 2.0
#
#Section 1: Base Color
#[R] [G] [B]            base RGB for the block
#[Minimum Light Value]  Blocks that emit light should set this to a high
#                       value. By default .1 is good.
#
#Section 2: Random Color
#[R] [G] [B]            Color for additive random noise
#[Noise Offset]         Offset for noise, by making this too small, you will
#                       get turbulence.
#
#Section 3: Noise Set
#[X] multiplier (how quickly noise changes in the X direction)
#[Y]  ''               ''                ''       Y      ''
#[Z]  ''               ''                ''       Z      ''
#[Diffuse Override]	This changes how (un)important the diffuse term is
#
#Section 4: Noise Mux
#Noise amplitudes of return from 4 noise functions.
#Good perlin noise would be like:
# .6 .3 .15 .075
#
#Section 5: Core
#In order to represent trees and other things tat modulus in unusual ways
#we need to calculate a core.  This determines the orientation for a modulus
#system for the noise.  0 0 1 0 means don't do anything 15 0 1 1 produces
#something that looks a lot like the rings of wood on a tree.
#
#You probably wont end up using this.
#
#Section 6: Time Settings
#This creates a vector to translate the input into noise by as a function of
#time.  Think of this as a "flow" vector.
#
#Section 7: Sparkles
#This section is used to create sparkles.  It allows for sharp discontinuities
#in the perlin noise.  Use it primarily when drawing ore.
#
#
#Section 8: Shader ending Terms
# TBD
